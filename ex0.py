# Exercise 0: The Setup

# So this is me being a smartie pants, because I know a tiny little bit of python, enough to write comments in Python scripts and do the following:
print "Hello World!\n"
# I also know how to run this in the command line!
# $ python lpthw00.py
# Woo Hoo!
#
# Note that I have also "read" this lesson (exercise 0), I mostly skipped the information for MacOS and Windows, and I am using Ubuntu 12.04, where I have Python 2.7.3 installed. 
#
# I also like Google, so I will memorize the "python list functions" phrase to google it now and then. (Check http://instagram.com/p/q-tX-1JKGz, hopefully it will work.)
#
# Ok, now onto exercise 1...
#
# p.s.
# I must confess that I love Zed's Warnings for beginners!
#
# Update:
# So I went onto exercise 1, but there was that warning about reading absolutely everything, so forget about me skipping everything, I did end up reading the whole exercise 0.
