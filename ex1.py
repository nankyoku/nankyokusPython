# Exercise 1: A good first program

# Ok, I wanted to cheat and name this file lpthw01.py, but well..
# If I was in Mexico, I might have to use the following line (with the # included, that line is not intended to be a comment). 
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "this is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# Study drills
#
#1. Make your script print another line. 
print "Here, have your new line!"
#2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
print "I'm lazy, I would either need to erase all lines but this one, or just use a '#' to comment them. But I'm too excited because I just found out that '#' is called an octothorpe! It is also called pound, hash or mesh. I pick octothorpe!" 
# Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
# I already knew that '#' allows you to comment your scripts, this is, you can write notes for your self that won't be interpreted by Python... I will leave it there, but I really want to understand that part about Python being an interpreted language.
